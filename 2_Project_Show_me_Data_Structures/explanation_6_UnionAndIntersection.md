## Explanation_6: Union and Intersection of two LinkedLists
### Requirement:
The objective is to define functions that take in two linked lists and return new linked lists representing the union and intersection of the elements from the input lists.

### Implementation Overview:
The code defines a Node class to represent an individual node in a linked list, which contains a value and a reference to the next node (next). Additionally, a LinkedList class is implemented to manage the linked list, with methods to append new nodes, calculate the size of the list, and represent the list as a string.

Two functions, union and intersection, are defined to create linked lists that represent the union and intersection of two input linked lists.

### Union Function:
The union function constructs a linked list that contains all the unique elements from both input lists. It uses a Python set to store unique values as it iterates through both lists. After collecting all unique elements, a new linked list is created by appending each element from the set.

### Intersection Function:
The intersection function creates a linked list that contains the elements that are common to both input lists. It uses two sets to track the values from each list. It first adds all the elements from the first list to the first set. Then, it checks each element in the second list against the first set to identify common elements. These common elements are stored in the second set. Finally, a new linked list is created by appending each common element.

### Test Cases:
Four test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the union and intersection functions:

- Test Case 1: Both linked lists have some common and some unique elements.
- Test Case 2: Both linked lists have unique elements with no common elements.
- Test Case 3: Both linked lists are empty.
- Test Case 4: One linked list is empty and the other contains elements.

### Time and Space Complexity:
#### Time Complexity:
- The append and size methods of the LinkedList class have a time complexity of O(n).
- The union function has a worst-case time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the size of the first linked list and m is the size of the second linked list, since it must process all elements from both lists.
- The intersection function has a worst-case time complexity of O(n) for the case where n = m, as it must check each element of the second list against the set of elements from the first list.
#### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity for the union function is O(n + m) in the worst case, as it potentially stores all elements from both lists if all are unique.
- The space complexity for the intersection function is O(n) in the worst case, where n = m, as it stores the common elements which can be at most the size of one of the lists.

### Conclusion:
The provided code defines a simple linked list data structure and methods to compute the union and intersection of two linked lists. The union and intersection are constructed efficiently using set operations to ensure uniqueness and commonality of elements. The implementation is tested with various scenarios to ensure correctness.
